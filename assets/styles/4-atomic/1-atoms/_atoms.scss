// Atoms
//
// Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML
// tags, such as a form label, an input or a button. They’re fairly abstract and often not terribly
// useful on their own. However, they’re good as a reference in the context of a pattern library as
// you can see all your global styles laid out at a glance.
